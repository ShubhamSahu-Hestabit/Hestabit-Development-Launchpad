        "question": "Explain the financial risk management process",
        "answer": "Our financial risk management process involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating various financial risks that could impact our overall financial position and results of operations. \n\nThese risks include:\n\n1. Credit risk: We may be subject to credit risk if we are unable to collect amounts due from customers or counterparties, which could result in a de minimis risk of credit loss.\n2. Market risk: Our marketable securities and long-term investments are subject to market risks that could adversely affect our overall financial position, and tax law changes could also adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n3. Liquidity risk: If we are unable to raise additional capital in the future when we require it, our efforts to broaden our product portfolio or commercialization efforts could be limited.\n4. Operational risk: The process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system involves inherent costs and risks, including potential delays in access to, or errors in, critical business and financial information, substantial capital expenditures, additional administrative time and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the enhanced systems, demands on management time, and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to the enhanced systems.\n\nTo manage these risks, we use various techniques, including:\n\n1. Fair value measurements: We use quoted prices and observable inputs to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities, following the FASB accounting guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n2. Deferred tax accounting: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts reportable for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The primary factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our recent history of cumulative earnings or losses, expected reversals of taxable temporary timing differences, forecasts of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\n3. Uncertain tax positions: We assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets and reduce them by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included within the tax provision.\n\nOur financial risk management process also involves ongoing monitoring and review of our financial position and results of operations to identify and mitigate potential risks.",
