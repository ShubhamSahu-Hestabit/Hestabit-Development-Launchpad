# Day Learning – Semantic HTML Blog Page

This repository contains my **day-wise learning task** focused on building a
**semantic HTML5 blog page** without using CSS or JavaScript.

The task emphasizes **page structure, accessibility, and semantic correctness**
by solving a real-world engineering problem using only HTML.

---

## 📘 Learning Objective (Day Focus)

The goal of this task was to:

- Understand HTML page structure
- Practice semantic HTML5 elements
- Build a blog layout **without using `<div>`**
- Implement forms with validation
- Embed media using images
- Apply accessibility best practices
- Document learnings clearly

## 🧠 Problem Statement

High-tension (HT) transmission and distribution lines use insulator assemblies
to electrically isolate live conductors. Birds such as pigeons and large raptors
often perch or nest near these insulators.

Bird droppings and nesting debris contaminate insulator surfaces, leading to:
- Increased leakage current
- Surface tracking
- Flashover risk
- Higher maintenance and reliability issues

This blog explains the **problem, impact, and a safe mitigation concept**.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- HTML5 (Semantic Elements Only)
- No CSS
- No JavaScript

---

## 📗 Semantic HTML Elements Used

- `header`
- `nav`
- `main`
- `section`
- `article`
- `aside`
- `figure`
- `figcaption`
- `footer`
- `form`, `fieldset`, `legend`
- `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `button`

No `<div>` elements are used.

---

## ♿ Accessibility Features Implemented

- `aria-label` for navigation and landmark regions
- Descriptive `alt` text for all images
- `tabindex="0"` for keyboard navigation
- Proper `label` association for form inputs
- Native HTML validation using `required` attributes

---

## 📝 Form Implementation

The feedback form demonstrates:
- Text input
- Email input with validation
- Select dropdown
- Required field validation

No backend or form submission logic is included, as the focus is on semantic
HTML structure and accessibility.
