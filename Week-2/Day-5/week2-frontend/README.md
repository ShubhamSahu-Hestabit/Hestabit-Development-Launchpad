# WEARLY – Frontend Practice Project

This project was created as part of my **frontend learning journey**.  
The main goal was to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts** by building a small e-commerce–style user interface and understanding how real websites are structured and behave.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### HTML
- Structuring pages using semantic HTML elements
- Dividing layouts into navbar, hero, categories, products, and footer
- Writing readable and maintainable HTML for larger pages

### CSS
- Using **Flexbox and Grid** for layout creation
- Controlling spacing using padding, margin, and height
- Fixing extra white-space issues between sections
- Making layouts responsive using media queries
- Improving typography hierarchy using font sizes and line heights
- Building scalable product grids (desktop → tablet → mobile)

### JavaScript
- Rendering product data dynamically
- Implementing product filtering based on:
  - Category
  - Gender
  - Search input
  - Rating (High → Low, Low → High)
- Managing UI state (active filters, selected tabs)
- Understanding real-world frontend filtering logic

---

## 🚧 Problems Faced & Fixes

- **Too much spacing between sections**  
  → Reduced padding and min-height values

- **Hero section taking too much screen height**  
  → Adjusted grid structure and alignment

- **Product cards appearing too small**  
  → Updated grid column count and card sizing

- **Filters not feeling intuitive**  
  → Improved spacing and layout of filter controls

These problems helped me understand how small CSS and layout changes can strongly affect the overall UI.
