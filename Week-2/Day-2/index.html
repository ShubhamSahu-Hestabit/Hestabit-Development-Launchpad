        <h1>Intelligence at the Network Edge</h1>
        <p>
            Edge AI enables machine learning inference directly on connected devices,
            reducing latency, minimizing cloud dependency, and enabling real-time
            intelligence in distributed environments.

            <h2>Core Concept</h2>

            <p>
                Edge AI refers to the execution of machine learning models directly on edge
                devices such as sensors, gateways, and embedded systems instead of relying
                entirely on centralized cloud infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                By processing data closer to where it is generated, Edge AI significantly
                reduces network latency and bandwidth usage while enabling real-time
                decision making for time-sensitive applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                This approach improves system reliability in environments with limited or
                intermittent connectivity and allows critical operations to continue even
                when cloud access is unavailable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Edge-based intelligence also enhances data privacy by keeping sensitive
                information local, making it suitable for domains such as industrial
                automation, smart surveillance, healthcare devices, and autonomous systems.

            <h3>Why Edge AI Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Applications like smart surveillance, autonomous systems, industrial
                automation, and healthcare monitoring depend on instant response times.
                Edge AI enables these systems to operate reliably even in offline or
                constrained network conditions.
